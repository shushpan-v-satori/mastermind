# Matermind game

https://shushpan-v-satori.github.io/mastermind/

Offline Mastermind is a two-person code breaker game where one person creates a code and the second person tries to break it.
In this version of the game, the computer will be creating the code and the player will be trying to break it.

## Description
The game starts with computer (codemaker) generating a pattern of four code pegs (represented by four question marks on top of the screen). Colors do not repeat in the code.
The player (codebreaker) tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
The player populates a row of guesses and confirms it.
Once confirmed, the codemaker provides feedback by showing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. 

A black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. 
A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.

The player can erase guesses befor the confirmation is pressed.

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows on the decoding board are full.

At any point in time code breaekr can reset the game (start a new game with new code).
